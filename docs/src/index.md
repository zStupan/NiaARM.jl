# NiaARM.jl

NiaARM.jl is a Julia framework for mining numerical association rules based on nature-inspired algorithms for optimization. Inspired by the [NiaARM](https://github.com/firefly-cpp/NiaARM) Python package, this package brings the power of numerical association rule mining to the Julia ecosystem.

## Features

- Load datasets from CSV files.
- Preprocess data for mining.
- Search for numerical association rules.
- Use built-in implementations of several state-of-the-art nature-inspired optimization algorithms.
- Generate statistics for discovered rules.
